There's a moment every founder knows. You've built something &mdash; maybe not perfect, but real. The landing page is live. The product works (mostly). And then you open your inbox, check your analytics, and see the same number staring back at you:

**Zero.**

No signups. No demo requests. No one banging down the door. Just you and the void.

Here's the uncomfortable truth that nobody tells you at demo day: the hardest part of building a startup isn't building the product. It's getting the first ten people to care about it.

Paul Graham put it best when he told founders to "do things that don't scale." But what does that actually look like? Not in theory. In practice. With no budget, no brand, and no network.

This is the playbook.

## Channel 1: Show Up at the Door

Yes, literally.

Before you roll your eyes &mdash; this is how some of the most iconic companies started. The Airbnb founders went door to door in New York, photographing apartments and convincing hosts to list them. DoorDash's founding team personally delivered meals to validate demand. Stripe's founders would sit down with startups and install the integration for them, on the spot.

The lesson isn't that door-to-door sales is the future. It's that **physical presence creates a kind of trust that no email can replicate.**

Here's what the numbers tend to look like: if you walk into offices or businesses cold, roughly one in four visits will get you a real conversation with a decision-maker. Compare that to cold email, where you're lucky to break a two-in-a-hundred response rate. That's a massive difference in signal quality.

The secret is the hook. You have five seconds &mdash; maybe less &mdash; to earn their attention. Don't start with what your product does. Start with the problem they have. "Are you still doing [painful thing] manually?" works better than any feature pitch.

**When to use this channel:**
- You're in the first 30 days and need to learn, fast
- Your target customers have physical locations (offices, stores, clinics)
- You need high-signal feedback, not just vanity metrics

**When to move on:**
- Once you've validated your pitch and pricing, this channel doesn't scale. That's fine. It was never meant to. It's a learning machine, not a growth engine.

## Channel 2: LinkedIn &mdash; The Underrated Outreach Machine

If cold email is a crowded bar where everyone's shouting, LinkedIn is the quiet lounge next door where people actually listen.

The data backs this up. LinkedIn outreach consistently converts at three to five times the rate of cold email. Why? Because LinkedIn messages land in a less noisy inbox, your profile provides instant context, and there's an inherent professional trust that email lacks.

Here's the sequence that works:

**Step 1: Connect (without pitching)**
Send a connection request with a short, genuine note. Something like: "Hi Sarah &mdash; saw you're building in [industry]. Would love to connect." No product mention. No ask.

**Step 2: Ask a question**
Once connected, send a message that starts with curiosity, not a pitch. "How are you currently handling [specific pain point]?" This opens a real conversation. If they respond, you've earned their attention.

**Step 3: Offer value, then invite**
Only after genuine exchange: "We've been working on something that addresses this. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute walkthrough?" The conversion rate on this step is dramatically higher because you've built context first.

**The math:**
LinkedIn limits you to roughly 200 connection requests per week per account. With a well-targeted approach &mdash; filtering by industry, company size, and job title &mdash; you can reach 800+ qualified prospects a month. If even a small fraction convert to calls, that's a pipeline from nothing.

**When to use this channel:**
- Your customers are B2B professionals
- You can clearly identify them by role, industry, or company size
- You need a scalable channel that doesn't require a budget

**Pro tip:** Resist the urge to automate everything. The best-performing LinkedIn outreach still feels personal. One genuine question beats a hundred templated pitches.

## Channel 3: Cold Calling (Yes, Really)

Nobody wants to do this. That's exactly why it works.

While every other startup is fighting for attention in email inboxes and LinkedIn feeds, the phone sits there, wide open. Most founders avoid cold calling because it feels uncomfortable. But discomfort is a moat &mdash; if your competitors won't do it, and you will, that's an edge.

Let's be honest about the numbers: cold calling converts at roughly one percent end-to-end. That sounds brutal. But run the math. If you make a hundred calls a day and close one customer per day, that's twenty customers a month. For most early-stage companies, that's transformative.

A few tactical notes:

- **Local numbers matter.** If your target market is in the US and you're calling from a local number, answer rates jump significantly. People screen international and unknown toll-free numbers.
- **The opening line is everything.** Don't say "Hi, I'm calling from CompanyX about our solution for..." Instead: "Hi, quick question &mdash; who handles [specific function] at your company?" Get them talking before they can say no.
- **Track your CAC carefully.** Cold calling is time-intensive. Know your cost per acquired customer and make sure the unit economics work. For high-value B2B deals, they usually do. For $20/month SaaS, they usually don't.

**When to use this channel:**
- High-value B2B sales where one customer is worth $1,000+
- Markets where email and LinkedIn are saturated
- When you want to complement other channels, not replace them

## Channel 4: Content That Sells While You Sleep

The first three channels are active outreach &mdash; you push, they respond. Content marketing is the opposite: you build something valuable, and customers come to you.

The catch? It compounds over time, which means the payoff is delayed. Industry data consistently shows that content marketing takes six to twelve months to produce meaningful results. But once it kicks in, it's the most efficient customer acquisition channel there is.

Here's what works for early-stage founders:

**The magic post format:**
Ask about an industry-specific pain point. Something like: "What's the most frustrating part of [industry-specific process]?" These posts generate engagement because people love talking about their problems. The comments become a goldmine of leads and product insights.

**Consistency beats virality.**
One viral post won't build a pipeline. Three posts a week for six months will. The founders who win at content aren't better writers &mdash; they're more consistent. Pick a cadence you can sustain and stick to it.

**Personal brand as multiplier.**
People follow people, not companies. Your personal story &mdash; the founder journey, the lessons, the failures &mdash; resonates more than any corporate content. Share what you're learning in real-time. The vulnerability is the differentiator.

**When to use this channel:**
- Start now. Seriously. Even if you're doing door-to-door sales today, start posting. By the time you need inbound leads, your content will be working.
- Best for: B2B companies, knowledge-intensive industries, founders who have opinions

## The Channel Comparison

Not every channel is right for every stage. Here's a quick way to think about the tradeoffs:

**Speed to first customer:**
Physical outreach and cold calling are fastest. You can get your first customer this week. LinkedIn outreach takes a few weeks to build momentum. Content takes months.

**Scalability:**
Content and LinkedIn scale beautifully. Physical outreach and cold calling don't. That's okay &mdash; use them to learn, then graduate to scalable channels.

**Cost (relative):**
All four channels are essentially free in terms of cash. They cost time, which is different. Physical outreach is the most time-intensive per lead. Content is the most time-efficient at scale.

**Best for:**
- Physical outreach: Learning, high-value local B2B
- LinkedIn: Scalable B2B outreach with no budget
- Cold calling: High-value deals, phone-friendly markets
- Content: Long-term inbound, brand building, thought leadership

## The Real Secret

Here's what the playbook actually comes down to: **the best channel is the one you'll actually do consistently.**

Don't pick the channel that sounds the most sophisticated. Pick the one that matches your personality, your market, and your tolerance for discomfort. The founder who makes a hundred LinkedIn connections a week will beat the one who spends three weeks building the "perfect" content strategy and never publishes.

You don't need a marketing budget. You don't need a growth team. You don't even need a perfect product.

You need persistence, a willingness to talk to strangers, and the humility to listen to what they tell you.

Start today. Pick one channel. Do it for thirty days straight. The customers will come &mdash; not because your funnel is optimized, but because you showed up.
