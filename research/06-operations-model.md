# Colater - Operations Model & Key Insights

## How It Actually Works (Behind the Scenes)
1. **Human designer** (you) directs the AI agents
2. Agents produce faster outputs than a human team could alone
3. Human reviews, refines, and ensures quality
4. Agents work *continuously* — not just when asked

## The "Always-On" Angle
This is a key differentiator vs traditional agencies:
- Agents are always running, looking for opportunities
- **Weekly reports** on agent progress sent to clients
- Example: "Marketing Agent identified an SEO opportunity, drafted blog pages — take a look directly in the CMS"
- Clients get proactive value, not just reactive deliverables

## Weekly Report Examples (for landing page copy)
- "Research Agent found 3 competitor brand updates this week"
- "Brand Copywriter drafted 5 new tagline variants based on market feedback"
- "Marketing Agent identified an SEO opportunity and drafted 2 blog pages — review them in your CMS"
- "Design System Agent updated your component library with new patterns"
- "Asset Generator created 12 social media variants for your product launch"

## Pain Points to Address (Problem Section)
1. **Too slow** — Traditional agencies take weeks/months. Startups need days.
2. **Too expensive** — Agency retainers are $10-30k/mo. Startups can't afford it.
3. **Too rigid** — Long contracts, limited revisions, waterfall process. No iteration.

Colater's answer to all three:
- Fast: AI agents work 24/7, human reviews daily
- Affordable: $500-2k per project, no massive retainers
- Flexible: Tight iteration loops, continuous agent monitoring
