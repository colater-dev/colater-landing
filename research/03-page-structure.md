# Colater - Page Structure & Decisions

## Hero Section
- Angle: "The AI-Powered Design Agency for Founders who want to iterate fast"
- Warm & approachable tone
- CTA leads to Onboarding Agent (intelligent form)

## Social Proof
- 2 startup logos with customer faces and testimonials
- Keep it compact, founder-focused

## How It Works / CTA
- **NOT a traditional "3 steps" section**
- Instead: "Talk to the Onboarding Agent" — an intelligent, conditionally-generated form
- The form itself IS the demo — shows the AI capability upfront
- Form should have some intelligence: adapts based on answers, sells the customer on working with Colater
- This is a key differentiator — the onboarding experience itself showcases the agent model

## Meet the Agents
- 6+ specialized agents
- **Display style**: Status updates — like a Slack channel
  - "Brand Copywriter just finished 5 tagline variants"
  - "Design System Agent has built your component library"
  - "Visual QA Agent found 3 consistency issues and fixed them"
- This creates a feeling of a busy, productive team working for you

## Agent Examples (Chat/Status Style)
- Show agents reporting progress
- Slack-channel-like UI
- Each agent shows a status update demonstrating its value
