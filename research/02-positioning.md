# Colater - Positioning & Team

## Positioning
Solo founder + fleet of 6+ specialized AI agents.
The pitch: One senior designer with AI superpowers can outperform a traditional agency team.

## Target Client
Pre-seed / Seed startups
- Need to look legit fast
- Budget-conscious
- Moving quickly
- Often founder-led, no in-house design

## AI Agents (6+ specialized)
Ideas for agents to feature:
- **Design System Agent** - Builds and maintains consistent component libraries
- **Brand Copywriter Agent** - Taglines, voice, messaging, content
- **Research Agent** - Competitor analysis, market research, trend identification
- **Visual QA Agent** - Pixel-perfect review, consistency checks, accessibility
- **Asset Generator Agent** - Rapid generation of social assets, marketing materials
- **Competitor Analysis Agent** - Deep dives into competitor branding and positioning
- **Accessibility Agent** - WCAG compliance, inclusive design checks
- **Style Guide Agent** - Generates and maintains living style documentation

## Brand Assets
Starting fresh - no existing logo, colors, or fonts.
Need to define visual identity as part of this project.

## Key Differentiator
Not "AI replaces designers" — it's "world-class designer + AI agents = agency-level output from one person."
Speed + quality + tight iteration loops at startup-friendly pricing.
