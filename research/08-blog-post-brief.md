## Content Structure (from user's notes)

### 4 Channels Covered:
1. **Cold Physical Outreach** (door-to-door)
   - High effort, low scalability, great learning
   - ~25% meeting conversion from office visits (use as ratio, not absolute)
   - Hook in first few seconds matters
   - Reference: Airbnb door-to-door, DoorDash founders doing deliveries

2. **LinkedIn Automation**
   - 3-5x better conversion than email
   - Less crowded channel
   - Sequence: connect → question → demo invite
   - ~200 requests/week limit per account
   - Targeting: industry, size, designation

3. **Cold Calling**
   - US numbers increase answer rates significantly
   - ~1% overall conversion
   - High CAC challenge
   - Main challenge: initial engagement, not tech setup

4. **Social Media & Content**
   - Consistent posting drives inbound
   - Industry-specific pain points + visual content
   - Long-term compound returns
   - Personal brand as multiplier

### Key Rules:
- Remove references to specific domain (payments/fintech/IT services)
- Keep generic, give examples across industries if needed
- Use ratios not absolutes for metrics
- Augment with web research (industry benchmarks, founder stories)
- Make it engaging storytelling, not a dry guide

### Research to Weave In:
- Famous "do things that don't scale" stories (Airbnb, Stripe, DoorDash)
- LinkedIn vs email effectiveness data
- B2B cold outreach benchmarks
- Content marketing ROI timelines
- Channel comparison data
